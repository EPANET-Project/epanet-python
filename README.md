# epanet-python

## epamodule
A Python module that permits Epanet toolkit library calls from pure Python programs.
epanet2.py is generated from epanet2.h by ctypesgen

Example2.py is example2.c from toolkit help rewritten in Python as example of epamodule use.

## outbin
Python module for reading EpanetBinaryOutputFiles in OO mode
See help of class EpanetOutBin. 
At present it is a self contained pure Py module: a partial rewriting is planned
in a near future for use of outputapi C library.
