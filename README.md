# epanet-python
python wrapper for epanet library
Works with both Python 2.7 and 3.x

## epamodule
A Python module that permits Epanet toolkit library calls from pure Python programs.
Dropped interface generated by ctypesgen from epanet2.h  (beacause not working with 2.x and 3.x)

Example2.py is example2.c from toolkit help rewritten in Python as example of epamodule use.

## outbin
Python module for reading EpanetBinaryOutputFiles in OO mode
See help of class EpanetOutBin. 
At present it is a self contained pure Py module: a partial rewriting is planned
in a near future for use of outputapi C library.
